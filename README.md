# Library Project

Book Tracker was inspired by an assignment from the Odin Project's Full Stack course. This application allows users to add books to a personal library, update the read status of books, and remove books from the library.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Boxicons](https://github.com/atisawd/boxicons)

I began this project by building and testing the JavaScript structure to handle adding, searching, and removing book objects from the array representing the library. I then created the form, table, and buttons that make up the user interface. Finally, I added styling to the page. 

## Future Goals

- Add a test suite 
- Design a card-style layout 
- Add a notes section for each book entry 
- Implement table sorting 
- Implement table searching


## Lessons Learned:

Prototype inheritance occurs when an object inherits from its prototype, which is just another object that links them together. This concept was initially confusing because my experience has been with class-based systems in C++ and Java. The coolest moment during this project was when I realized I could set the data attribute of an HTML element using an array index literal from JavaScript. Implementing event delegation on the status and remove containers was more challenging than I initially imagined.
